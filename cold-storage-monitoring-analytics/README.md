## Cold-Chain Monitoring for Grocery & Dark Stores

Cold-chain monitoring is a critical requirement in grocery retail, convenience stores, and dark-store fulfillment centers. Refrigerated and frozen storage units—such as chillers, freezers, walk-in cold rooms, and refrigerated racks—must consistently maintain strict temperature ranges to keep perishable food safe. Even small deviations can lead to product spoilage, inventory loss, regulatory non-compliance, increased costs, and potential health risks. This project implements a real-time cold-chain monitoring platform designed to simulate sensor data and process it through a full modern streaming-analytics pipeline using Redpanda, Flink, ClickHouse, and Metabase, all deployed via Docker Compose on an EC2 instance.

The primary goal of the system is to continuously ingest, process, and analyze temperature and door-state data coming from cold-storage assets in grocery and dark-store environments. The project includes a realistic data generator that simulates multiple refrigeration assets producing telemetry at fixed intervals. This simulated data mimics real-world behaviors such as cooling/heating patterns, door-open temperature spikes, occasional excursions outside safe ranges, noise in readings, and different behavior for chillers versus freezers. The generator acts as the IoT edge layer, producing JSON events to Redpanda topics using Kafka API compatibility.

Redpanda serves as the central message streaming system, replacing traditional Kafka but providing the same APIs. Redpanda is lightweight, extremely fast, and operates without ZooKeeper, making it ideal for containerized environments and EC2 deployments. This project uses Redpanda in a single-node configuration suitable for development. Temperature readings and door events stream into Redpanda topics, where they form the raw data backbone of the entire system. Redpanda Console is included to inspect topics, messages, consumer groups, and cluster status in real time.

Apache Flink is used as the real-time stream processing engine. Flink jobs consume the temperature and door event streams from Redpanda and apply transformations such as windowing, aggregation, and event correlation. For example, Flink computes rolling averages, tracks time spent inside or outside the safe temperature range, detects excursions, identifies patterns like prolonged door openings that correlate with temperature spikes, and produces real-time alerts when conditions exceed thresholds. Flink’s event-time windowing, exactly-once semantics, and state management make it well-suited for this kind of real-time operational monitoring use case.

ClickHouse serves as the analytical database layer. It is a high-performance columnar storage engine optimized for time-series analytics, making it ideal for storing large volumes of cold-chain telemetry. The project defines several tables in ClickHouse, including raw temperature events, door events, aggregated one-minute metrics, and alert tables generated by Flink. ClickHouse supports fast queries across millions of rows, which enables dashboards and analyses to be computed in real time. Retention policies, partitioning, and MergeTree engines are leveraged to maintain performance and manage storage needs.

Metabase sits on top as the BI and visualization layer. It connects to ClickHouse using the HTTP interface and provides dashboards for asset performance, temperature trends, door activity, time-in-range KPIs, excursion logs, and store-level summaries. These dashboards are designed for real operational use — for example, a store manager could quickly identify which freezer is behaving abnormally or which asset frequently experiences temperature spikes due to long door-open events. Metabase also supports alerts and scheduled reporting, which could be extended to send compliance summaries or nightly reports to operations teams.

The entire system runs on Docker Compose for easy orchestration. Each component—Redpanda, ClickHouse, Flink JobManager and TaskManager, the data generator, and Metabase—is defined as a container within the compose file. Persistent volumes are configured for both Redpanda and ClickHouse to maintain data durability across container restarts. The compose file is optimized for EC2 environments with reasonable resource constraints, ensuring smooth operation even on modest instance types. Networking is handled through the Docker Compose network, allowing all services to communicate internally without exposing sensitive ports to the public internet.

From a business standpoint, this system replicates the critical functionality used by large grocery chains to maintain compliance and reduce waste. Continuous monitoring allows companies to reduce spoilage, detect failing equipment early, monitor operational behavior such as frequent door openings, and maintain audit-ready logs of temperature performance for food safety regulators. In dark-store environments—where rapid picking and fulfillment are essential—underperforming cold storage can directly impact order quality and customer satisfaction. The real-time nature of the system helps detect and act on issues before they escalate, potentially saving per incident.

This project is also designed as a strong data engineering and streaming systems showcase. It demonstrates mastery of Kafka-compatible streaming (via Redpanda), real-time processing with Apache Flink, schema design and time-series storage with ClickHouse, and visualization using Metabase. It covers essential patterns in modern data engineering: event-driven architecture, streaming pipelines, time-windowed transformations, near-real-time analytics, container orchestration, and end-to-end data flow design. The pipeline could easily be extended to include machine learning models for anomaly detection or predictive maintenance, or migrated into a Kubernetes-based deployment using Helm charts and operators for each component.

Overall, the Cold-Chain Monitoring for Grocery & Dark Stores project provides a complete, realistic, and technically rich solution that simulates and processes operational IoT-like data at scale. It reflects the architecture used in modern retail operations for ensuring product safety, preventing inventory loss, optimizing store operations, and achieving compliance. Through Redpanda, Flink, ClickHouse, and Metabase, the project delivers a robust analytics pipeline that transforms raw temperature telemetry into actionable insights and operational dashboards suitable for real-world environments.
