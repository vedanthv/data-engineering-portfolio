## [UserMingle : Kafka-Driven User Profile Streaming]() ðŸ§”

**Brief Overview**

In this project, I have used the [Random User Generator](https://randomuser.me/) API to fetch data intermittedly using Airflow DAG pipelines and store the data in Postgres DB.
The entire streaming process is managed by a Kafka setup that has a Zookeeper pipeline to manage multiple broadcasts and process them from the message queue. There is a master-worker architecture setup on Apache Spark. Finally there is a Cassandra DB setup that has a listener that takes the stream data from Spark and stores in a columnar format. The entire project is containerized with Docker.

**Tech Stack**

- **Apache Airflow**: Responsible for orchestrating the pipeline and storing fetched data in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Apache Kafka and Zookeeper**: Used for streaming data from PostgreSQL to the processing engine.
- **Control Center and Schema Registry**: Helps in monitoring and schema management of our Kafka streams.
- **Apache Spark**: For data processing with its master and worker nodes.
- **Cassandra**: Where the processed data will be stored.

**Setup and Requirements**

1. Clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/vedanthv/data-engineering-portfolio.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```cd data-engineering-portfolio/user-mingle```

3. Run Docker Compose to Spin Up the Service
```docker-compose up```
