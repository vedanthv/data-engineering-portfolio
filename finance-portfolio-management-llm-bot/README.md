### How things work?

#### üìå Price Agent

The PriceAgent is a serverless component within this project that acts as a bridge between the Zerodha KiteConnect API and the wider system. Its primary role is to fetch live market prices and portfolio holdings from Zerodha, enrich the data, and expose it in a standardized JSON format for downstream agents, dashboards, or analytics workflows.

This agent is implemented as an Azure Function (HTTP-triggered), making it lightweight, scalable, and easy to integrate with other microservices or cloud-native components.

**üîë Responsibilities of PriceAgent**

**Authentication & Secure Access**

- Reads Zerodha API credentials (ZERODHA_API_KEY, ZERODHA_ACCESS_TOKEN) from environment variables.
- Ensures no sensitive data is hardcoded.

**Holdings Retrieval**

Calls the kite.holdings() endpoint to fetch the user‚Äôs portfolio (symbols, quantities, and average buy price).

**Live Market Data Enrichment**

- For each stock, fetches the latest market price (LTP) via kite.quote().
- Combines holdings with real-time price updates.

**Standardized JSON Output**

Returns structured portfolio data containing:

```
qty (quantity held)

average_price (buy price per stock)

last_price (live market price)
```

**Error Handling & Observability**

- Logs function execution for monitoring in Azure.
- Returns clear error responses in JSON format for resilience.

**üì° Example Output from PriceAgent**

```json
{
  "INFY": {
    "qty": 10,
    "average_price": 1400.5,
    "last_price": 1523.0
  },
  "TCS": {
    "qty": 5,
    "average_price": 3120.0,
    "last_price": 3255.6
  }
}
```
