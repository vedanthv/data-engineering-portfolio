## Introduction and Problem Statement

In the bustling world of digital media, YouTube shines as a dynamic stage for content creators to showcase their videos and connect with audiences around the globe.

Yet, the avalanche of daily uploads turns the task of extracting valuable insights from viewer comments and gauging audience sentiment into a formidable challenge.

Enter our project, which harnesses the YouTube Data API and OpenAI's powerful Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize the way creators analyze their channels, videos, and comments.

Sifting through YouTube comments manually is a tedious and time-draining endeavor, making it tough for creators to glean crucial insights about their audience's feelings, preferences, and engagement habits.

But this doesn't mean creators should abandon reading feedback directly! Instead, our aim is to supercharge the analysis process, allowing for the swift extraction of specific feedback without wading through countless comments.

The sheer flood of comments also makes it difficult to spot and prioritize vital feedback.

Our project offers a groundbreaking solution by automating the analysis of viewer comments, seamlessly integrating OpenAI's Language Models (LLMs) with the YouTube Data API.

Through advanced AI-driven natural language processing, our system automatically uncovers insights from chosen YouTube channels, performing sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and tracking audience engagement metrics.

This innovative automation empowers content creators to delve deeper into their audience's minds, understanding preferences, sentiments, and engagement patterns, which in turn helps them fine-tune their content strategies, optimize engagement techniques, and sharpen audience targeting.

By streamlining the analysis process, our solution equips creators to make informed, data-driven decisions swiftly and efficiently, conserving time and resources while amplifying the impact of their content.

## Key Goals of The Project

- [ ] **Dashboard for creators** to view analytics of their channel in one place

- [ ] **Sentiments of comments** on the top 5-10 videos on the channel.

- [ ] Auto generation of captions for the videos and **complete analysis of the words using NLP**, possibly a prompt to ChatGPT and giving suggestions to improve the language for better viewership.

- [ ] **Smart Description and Thumbnail Generation** by filtering out top videos with the same tags as the genre of the channel and using it to generate new thumbnails.
